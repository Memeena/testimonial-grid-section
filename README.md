## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to use Grid in this scenario. First I determined the size of the grid by considering the smallest area and kept it as 1 cell. Then I calculated the cells for rows and columns. Here in this challenge, 
  
  - the first cell spans across 2 columns in the first row
  - the second cell is just one column and 1 row
  - third starts in the second row and spans 1 column
  - fourth starts in second row and spans 2 column
  - fifth starts in first row and spans 2 rows.

While the viewport size decreases, it automatically fits the screen size since I have used auto-fit and minmax property.

This makes it easy when for mobile use, since not much coding is needed. But I had a problem when tried to display all the cells in a single column. Since I have explicitly given where the cell should be placed in the row and column using grid-row and grid-column, it did not change as it should be. So I had to change this part for screen size less than 900px where it changes to single column.
